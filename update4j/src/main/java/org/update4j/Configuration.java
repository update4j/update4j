/**
 * This class is the heart of the framework. It contains all the logic required
 * to draft new releases at the development side, or start the application at
 * the client side.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although everything is contained in a single class; some methods are intended
 * to run either on the dev machine -- to draft new releases -- or client
 * machine, not both. The documentation of each method will point that out.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A configuration (or config) is linked to an XML file, and this class provide
 * methods to read, write, generate and sync configurations. Once a
 * configuration has been created, it is immutable and cannot be modified. There
 * are methods to manipulate the XML elements and create new configurations from
 * them, but the original remains untouched.
 * 
 * <h2>Terminology</h2>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Bootstrap Application</b> &mdash; The JVM startup application that
 * solely does the update and launch logic or anything at that level apart from
 * the Business Application.</li>
 * <li><b>Business Application</b> &mdash; The application you actually want to
 * make updatable.</li>
 * <li><b>Boot Classpath/Modulepath</b> &mdash; The JVM native
 * classpath/modulepath where the bootstrap is usually loaded.</li>
 * <li><b>Dynamic Classpath/Modulepath</b> &mdash; The dynamically loaded
 * classpath/modulepath where the business application is loaded.</li>
 * <li><b>URI</b> &mdash; The remote (or in case of {@code file:///} -- local)
 * location <em>from where</em> the file is downloaded.</li>
 * <li><b>Path</b> &mdash; The local location <em>to where</em> the file should
 * be downloaded on the client machine.</li>
 * <li><b>Service</b> &mdash; Any of the service interfaces that can be provided
 * by developers and easily updatable by releasing newer providers with a higher
 * version number.</li>
 * <li><b>Property</b> &mdash; Any of the key-value pairs listed in the config
 * file. Can be used as placeholders in URI's, paths, class names, file comments
 * or in values of other properties.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h1>Developer Side</h1>
 * <p>
 * You should primarily use this class whenever you want to draft a new release
 * to generate new configs. This might be done directly in code or be called by
 * build tools.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are 3 ways generate configs.
 * 
 * <h3>1. Using the Builder API</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@link Configuration#builder()} is the entry point to the config builder API.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Here's a sample config created with this approach:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Configuration config = Configuration.builder()
 *                 // resolve uri and path of each individual file against the base.
 *                 // if not present you must provider the absolute location to every individual file
 *                 // with the uri() and path() method
 *                 .baseUri("http://example.com/")
 * 
 *                 // reads actual value from client system property "user.home"
 *                 .basePath("${user.home}/myapp/")
 * 
 *                 // list all files from the given directory
 *                 .files(FileMetadata.streamDirectory("build/mylibs")
 *                                 // mark all jar files for classpath
 *                                 .peek(r -> r.classpath(r.getSource().toString().endsWith(".jar"))))
 * 
 *                 .file(FileMetadata.readFrom("otherDirectory/my-logo.png")
 * 
 *                                 //override http://example.com above
 *                                 .uri("https://s3.aws.com/some-location/img.png")
 * 
 *                                 // resolves base from basePath but
 *                                 // overrides my-logo.png from source
 *                                 .path("application-logo.png"))
 * 
 *                 // we're done!
 *                 .build();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>2. Synchronizing Existing Configuration</h3>
 * <p>
 * If you already have a configuration but you changed files without adding or
 * removing files, you might synchronize the file size, checksum and signature
 * (if you use signature validation) without using the builder API, via
 * {@link Configuration#sync()}. A new config will be returned, the existing
 * config remains untouched:
 * 
 * <p>
 * Given this XML {@code config.xml}:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &lt;configuration timestamp="2018-08-22T19:31:40.448450500Z"&gt;
 *     &lt;base uri="https://example.com/" path="${user.loc}"/&gt;
 *     &lt;properties&gt;
 *         &lt;property key="user.loc" value="${user.home}/Desktop/"/&gt;
 *     &lt;/properties&gt;
 *     &lt;files&gt;
 *         &lt;file path="file1.jar" size="1348" checksum="fd7adfb7"/&gt;
 *     &lt;/files&gt;
 * &lt;/configuration&gt;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * You can synchronize it as:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Configuration config = Configuration.read(Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get("config.xml")));
 * 
 * // read files from actual locations listed in config
 * // in our case ${user.home}/Desktop/file1.jar
 * Configuration newConfig = config.sync();
 * 
 * // read files from different base path but same individual file name
 * // in our case ./build/file1.jar where "." is current directory
 * Configuration newConfig = config.sync(Paths.get("build"));
 * 
 * // read files from actual locations listed in config
 * // and sign with given PrivateKey
 * KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance("JKS");
 * ks.load(Files.newInputStream(keystorePath), "Password1".toCharArray());
 * 
 * PrivateKey pk = (PrivateKey) ks.getKey("alias", "Password2".toCharArray());
 * Configuration newConfig = config.sync(pk);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you want to add a new file you should manually add the filename in the
 * config XML and {@code sync()} will do the rest:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &lt;files&gt;
 *         &lt;file path="file1.jar" size="1348" checksum="fd7adfb7"/&gt;
 *         
 *         &lt;!-- The new file --&gt;
 *         &lt;file path="file2.jar" /&gt;
 * &lt;/files&gt;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>3. Manual XML Manipulation</h3>
 * <p>
 * You can access the XML DOM with the {@link ConfigMapper} class and load a
 * config using {@link Configuration#parse(ConfigMapper)} to obtain a new
 * configuration. You can also write a mapper without parsing &mdash;
 * essentially skipping all validations &mdash; by the
 * {@link ConfigMapper#write(Writer)}.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ConfigMapper mapper = new ConfigMapper();
 * mapper.baseUri = "https://example.com/"
 * 
 * FileMapper file = new FileMapper();
 * file.path = "/root/home/file.jar";
 * file.size = 3082;
 * file.checksum = "ac29bfa0";
 * mapper.files.add(file);
 * 
 * Configuration config = Configuration.parse(mapper);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Or access the underlying mapper of an existing config (it creates a defensive
 * copy, so cache them once):
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ConfigMapper mapper = config.generateXmlMapper();
 * mapper.files.remove(0);
 * 
 * Configuration newConfig = Configuration.parse(mapper);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h2>Writing the Configuration</h2>
 * <p>
 * Once you successfully created a config, write them with
 * {@link Configuration#write(Writer)}:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * try (Writer out = Files.newBufferedWriter(location)) {
 *     config.write(out);
 * }
 * 
 * // or get a String
 * String theXml = config.toString();
 * system.out.println(theXml);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h1>Client Side</h1>
 * <p>
 * A config in the client serves two purposes: 1. Know when a file is outdated
 * and requires an update when {@code update()} is called 2. List of files to be
 * dynamically loaded onto the running JVM when {@code launch()} is called.
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * All logic on the client side is generally done in the bootstrap application,
 * like reading the config (and usually caching it somewhere locally in case
 * there's no Internet connection next time), updating and launching or whatever
 * needs to be done before launch or after business app shutdown or anywhere in
 * between, according to your needs.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to use the config you must first read it from a file or remote
 * location.
 * 
 * <h2>Reading a Configuration</h2>
 * <p>
 * Read a config using the {@link Configuration#read(Reader)}:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Configuration config = null;
 * 
 * try (InputStream in = new URL("https://example.com/config.xml").openStream()) {
 *     config = Configuration.read(new InputStreamReader(in));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h2>Updating</h2>
 * <p>
 * Updating is done by calling any of the {@code update()} methods. You can
 * update without signature validation, or with, by using the {@link PublicKey}
 * overloads.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can update before launching so the subsequent launch always has the
 * newest version, or you can update afterwards and only get the new version on
 * next restart. In the latter case &mdash; on Windows &mdash; you cannot update
 * existing files, since the JVM locks them upon launch; you can call any of the
 * {@code updateTemp()} overloads and complete the update on next restart via
 * {@link Update#finalizeUpdate(Path)}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When update is called without explicitly passing an {@link UpdateHandler}
 * instance and {@link Configuration#getUpdateHandler()} returns {@code null},
 * the framework will try to locate one between the registered service providers
 * and will use the one with the highest {@code version()} number. If
 * {@link Configuration#getUpdateHandler()} returns a class name, it will load
 * that class instead.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For more info how to register providers please refer to the <a
 * href=https://github.com/update4j/update4j/wiki/Documentation#dealing-with-providers>Github
 * Wiki</a>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Regular updating (not {@code updateTemp()}):
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // loads a registered provider or DefaultUpdateHandler if non are found.
 * config.update(); // returns a boolean if succeeded
 * 
 * // updates with given update handler
 * config.update(new MyUpdateHandler());
 * 
 * // update and inject fields to and from the handler
 * config.update(myInjector);
 * 
 * // update and validate against the public key
 * config.update(myPubKey);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Or you can update to a temporary location and finalize on next restart.
 * Here's a sample lifecycle:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
 *     // the temporary location
 *     Path temp = Paths.get("update");
 * 
 *     // first check if last run made a temp update
 *     if (Update.containsUpdate(temp)) {
 *         Update.finalizeUpdate(temp);
 *     }
 * 
 *     // some random method
 *     Configuration config = getConfig();
 *     // we don't want to hang, so we can update immediately
 *     new Thread(() -> config.launch()).start();
 * 
 *     // and *after* launch do the update
 *     if (config.requiresUpdate()) {
 *         config.updateTemp(temp);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Consistency</h3>
 * <p>
 * If even a single file failed to download or if any other exception arises,
 * all downloads before the exception is rolled back to its original state as
 * before the call for update.
 * 
 * <h3>Boot Modulepath Conflicts</h3>
 * <p>
 * Every jar file gets checked if it were a valid file in boot modulepath; such
 * as if it's a valid zip file, duplicate module name, split package, valid
 * automatic module name etc., no matter if the file was actually intended to be
 * present in the boot modulepath. This was put in place to prevent accidentally
 * making the file visible to the boot modulepath and completely breaking the
 * application, as the JVM would resist to startup, thus not allowing this to be
 * fixed remotely.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If great care was taken that the given file will not be visible to the boot
 * modulepath (i.e. only to the dynamic path or boot <em>classpath</em>), it is
 * legal and you may override the check by marking
 * {@code ignoreBootConflict="true"} in the config file or via the corresponding
 * builder method.
 * 
 * <h3>Signature</h3>
 * <p>
 * Optionally, to secure your clients in the event of server compromise, you can
 * sign the configuration and files via the {@code signer()} method in the
 * Builder API, or {@link Configuration#sync(PrivateKey)}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The config signature ensures that it has not been tampered, as changed URIs,
 * paths or properties. Changes that are not significant to the framework, as
 * whitespaces or element/attribute order do not matter. Changing element order
 * in lists (i.e. properties or files) do change the ordering in the
 * end-resulting list, and is part of the signature. The {@code timestamp} field
 * is never part of the signature. To verify the config itself, read it with the
 * {@link #read(Reader, PublicKey)} overload, or invoke
 * {@link #verifyConfiguration(PublicKey)}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To verify files on update, use the {@link PublicKey} overload of
 * {@code update()} or {@code updateTemp()} and it will reject the download if
 * any file fails.
 * 
 * <h1>Launching</h1>
 * <p>
 * Launching loads files onto the dynamic classpath or modulepath (or does not
 * load it if not marked with either), depending on their configuration and
 * launches it by using either a passed {@link Launcher}, or by loading a
 * launcher provider.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Accessing business classes in the bootstrap depends on the classloader configuration. Please consult the
 * <a href="https://github.com/update4j/update4j/wiki/Documentation#classloading-model">
 * GitHub wiki</a> for a thorough walkthrough of possible options.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When launch is called without explicitly passing a {@link Launcher} instance
 * and {@link #getLauncher()} returns {@code null}, the framework will try to
 * locate one between the registered service providers and will use the one with
 * the highest {@code version()} number. If {@link #getLauncher()} returns a
 * class name, it will load that class instead.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If an explicit launcher instance was passed, the instance only has reflective access to
 * the Business Application by reflecting against
 * {@link LaunchContext#getClassLoader()} unless you used the {@link DynamicClassLoader}.
 * 
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // launch with registered launcher or DefaultLauncher if non were found
 * config.launch();
 * 
 * // launch and inject fields to and from the launcher
 * // assume the caller implements Injectable
 * config.launch(this);
 * 
 * // launch with passed launcher, *only reflective access*
 * config.launch(new MyLauncher());
 * 
 * // using DynamicClassLoader as context class loader
 * ClassLoader loader = new DynamicClassLoader();
 * Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(loader);
 * 
 * config.launch(new MyLauncher());
 * Class&lt?&gt; loader.loadClass("com.example.BusinessClass");
 * 
 * // starting the application with the flag -Djava.system.class.loader=org.update4j.DynamicClassLoader
 * BusinessClass business = new BusinessClass() // Boom, NoClassDefFoundError
 * 
 * config.launch();
 * BusinessClass business = new BusinessClass() // Works flawlessly
 * </pre>
