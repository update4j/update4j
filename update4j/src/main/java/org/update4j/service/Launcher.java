/**
 * An implementation of this interface can be used as an entry point to the
 * business application.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you wish to create your custom bootstrap but use the
 * {@link DefaultLauncher}, you might pass over a list of strings that will be
 * used as the arguments in {@code main}, by adding a field in the bootstrap:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @InjectSource}
 * private List&lt;String&gt; args;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * that contains the arguments, and launch by using one of the overloads that
 * take an {@link Injectable}:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * config.launch(this);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the launcher is started by the {@link DefaultBootstrap} but you define
 * your own launcher, you can capture the business command-line arguments by
 * adding this field in the launcher:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @InjectTarget}
 * private List&lt;String&gt; args;
 * </pre>
 *
