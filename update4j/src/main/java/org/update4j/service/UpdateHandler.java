/**
 * An implementation of this interface can be used to get callbacks on all
 * stages of the update process.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The order of the method invocation are precisely as follows:
 * 
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #init(UpdateContext)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #startCheckUpdates()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #updateCheckUpdatesProgress(float)} -- set to {@code 0f}</li>
 * <p>
 * For each file in the config:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #shouldCheckForUpdate(FileMetadata)}</li>
 * <p>
 * If previous call returned {@code true}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #startCheckUpdateFile(FileMetadata)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #doneCheckUpdateFile(FileMetadata, boolean)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <li>{@link #updateCheckUpdatesProgress(float)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <li>{@link #doneCheckUpdates()}</li>
 * <p>
 * If there are any files that need an update:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #startDownloads()}</li>
 * <p>
 * For each file requiring an update:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #startDownloadFile(FileMetadata)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #updateDownloadProgress(float)} -- on the first file only, set to
 * {@code 0f}</li>
 * <li>{@link #updateDownloadFileProgress(FileMetadata, float)} -- set to
 * {@code 0f}. You can observe the remote server latency between
 * {@code startDownloadFile()} and this</li>
 * <p>
 * Repeatedly, until file download completes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #updateDownloadFileProgress(FileMetadata, float)} -- updates the
 * fraction of {@code 1f}</li>
 * <li>{@link #updateDownloadProgress(float)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <li>{@link #validatingFile(FileMetadata, Path)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #doneDownloadFile(FileMetadata, Path)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <li>{@link #doneDownloads()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If successfully updated (or no updates were required, successfully):
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #succeeded()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Otherwise, for any exception, even if thrown by the update handler:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #failed(Throwable)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <li>{@link #stop()}</li>
 * </ul>
